Search, Pagination, and Ajax

Searching 

As you work with larger lists of data, we should simplify navigtion for users

How do we search data?
	simplest seach operates in a single field


How do we implement search? 
	view
		we need to add a text field to take input
	controller
		we need to modify our controller actions to handle a search query from our form
	model
		we need to filter data we display to only show matches of our query

Code-Along
	

	go to your view:
		<%= form_tag "/projects", method :"GET" do %>
		<%= text_field_tag '	', params[:q] %>
		<%= f.submit


	in routes: 
		get 'projects' => 'projects#index'


	in project.rb: 
		def self.search(query)
			if query
				Project.where("name = LIKE'%#{query}%'")
			else
				Project.all
			end
		end

	in controller:
		def index
			@projects = Project.search(params[:q])
			@project = Project.new

	in controller


PAGINATION

	use will_paginate
	go to github for will_paginate and put it in Gemfile
	bundle installl


	e.g. 
		@posts = Post.paginate(:page => params[page], :per_page => 10) #limits to 10 items per page

	then in view
		<%= will_paginate @projects %>
